Welcome to my website! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science, specializing in quantitative methods, at The Ohio State University.

My research falls under the umbrella of computational social science, with an interest in the application of techniques from machine learning and network science to social and political data. In my dissertation I produce novel estimates of how satisfied or dissatisfied every country has been with its international standing from 1816 to 2012, which I then use to forecast the onset of militarized interstate conflicts.

In addition, I am involved in ongoing projects about: detecting changepoints in varying-coefficient models, forecasting the onset of civil wars, public opinion about the threat posed by international terrorism, and the politics of multilateral military coalitions.

Prior to OSU, I earned a BA in International Relations from the University of California, Davis.
