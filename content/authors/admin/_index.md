Thank you for visiting my website! 

I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from The Ohio State University, where I specialized in computational social science and quantitative approaches to political science. I am currently on the data science job market in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In my research I apply techniques from machine learning and network science to social and political data. For my dissertation I develop a quantitative measure of every countryâ€™s sentiment toward its international standing from 1816-2012, which I then use as the core feature in a machine learning ensemble that forecasts the onset of military conflicts.

Other projects include: detecting changepoints in varying-coefficient models, forecasting the onset of civil wars, a survey experiment about public opinion toward the threat posed by international terrorism, and a quantitative study of the politics of contributions to multilateral alliances.

I have also taught a graduate-level course twice which prepares incoming Ph.D. students for their quantitative methods courses by teaching some foundations of calculus, linear algebra, and R programming. More course information is available [here](https://dnkent.github.io/talk/math-workshop/).

You can find my resume [here](/files/kent_resume.pdf).
