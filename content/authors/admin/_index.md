Thank you for visiting my website! 

I am a recent Ph.D. graduate and quantitative social scientist with over five years of experience in experimental and survey design, A/B testing, machine learning, and network science. I completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at The Ohio State University, where I specialized in quantitative approaches to social and political processes.

In my research I have worked on a variety of methodological and social topics, spanning from a nationwide survey experiment on U.S. public opinion to a dissertation about forecasting international conflict and detecting spillover effects in social networks. My research has been financially supported by the National Science Foundation, Mershon Center for International Security, and the Ohio State Decision Sciences Collaborative.

I have also taught a graduate-level course twice which prepares incoming Ph.D. students for their quantitative methods courses by teaching calculus, linear algebra, probability, and R programming. More course information is available [here](https://dnkent.github.io/talk/math-workshop/).

You can find my data science resume [here](/files/kent_resume.pdf) and my academic CV [here](/files/kent_cv.pdf).
