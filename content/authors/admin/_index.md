Welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at The Ohio State University, specializing in computational social science and international relations. In my research I apply techniques from network science and machine learning to topics in international relations, particularly the onset of conflict between and within countries. I also have worked on methods for detecting the presence of time-varying effects in panel data. 

<!-- Daniel Kent is a PhD candidate in Political Science at the Ohio State University. His research interests center around international relations and quantitative methods. More specifically, his work focuses on: the origins of revisionist states, computational models of international security competition, statistical techniques for capturing dynamic effects, and the role of global networks in state-level outcomes. -->

Prior to OSU, I earned a BA in International Relations from the University of California, Davis.
