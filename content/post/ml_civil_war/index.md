Can machine learning techniques be used to predict the onset of civil wars? We find that tree-based models
for machine learning, particularly gradient boosting machines, outperform canonical generalized linear models
from the political science literature as predictors of intrastate violence. Moreover, we find support for a novel
preditor of armed conflict -- the international arms trade network.
