A state's international dissatisfaction is central to theories of conflict and cooperation. However, due to dissatisfaction's unobservability, relevant empirical treatments either avoid measuring the concept altogether or rely on conceptually constrained proxies. In response to these methodological challenges, I propose a novel measure of international dissatisfaction spanning from 1816 to 2012 which explicitly operationalizes Gilpin's framework: the difference between a state's expected and actual benefits from the international status quo. 
I estimate a state's expected international benefits by building upon recent efforts to train machine learning ensembles on war outcomes, which I then use to weight a state's observable material capabilities.
I estimate actual international benefits by averaging across a state's centrality in valued international networks.
The measure provides multiple advantages over alternative estimates both conceptually and statistically. 
Indeed, beyond its conceptual value, the measure's association with militarized conflict is robust to model specifications, unlike the current go-to measure when modeling country-level sentiments: ideal point estimates from United Nations voting records.
